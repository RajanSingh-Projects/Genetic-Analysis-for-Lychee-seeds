# Genetic-Analysis-for-Lychee-seeds
This project aims at identifying the regulatory genes responsible for determining the seed size in Lychee fruits.  
We are using expression data from Lychee seeds to determine those regulatory genes.  
The methods used is Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis(WGCNA) and has been performed using the package  
in R with the same name, i.e., WGCNA.
